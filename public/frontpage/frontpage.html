            <p class="change">I am a highly motivated worker and I strive to grow myself professionally in this sphere as it is something that I have found my purpose in and wanted to do since a young age. 
                Moving to Denmark proves that I can adapt to situations rather quickly and take on new challenges with enthusiasm. In my work way I consider myself as a problem solver, 
                since I constantly aim to find the appropriate and correct response to every new challenge.</p>

            <p class="change">In relation to my professional experience in this industry, I have gathered most of my knowledge during my intense study program and through developing personal projects. 
    During 4 years in high school I focused on computer science as a main subject where I learned the basics of MySQL, C++ and Java. </p>

                Currently I am studying at KEA university in my second year as part of my AP degree in Computer Science. I was able to advance my knowledge with Java and MySQL, and I already consider myself at an Advanced level in them. I have worked with the Spring Boot Framework, HTML and CSS for my university projects and have extensive knowledge of them, for said projects I have also used Git for version control.
                 I have a basic understanding of Docker and AWS as well.
                  I am currently focusing on learning the basics of Python, NodeJS and .NET C#.

                Additionally, my work as a customer sales representative in SITEL has helped me foster my professional communication, 
                evolve as an accountable and honest person, work better in a team environment, 
                and manage my time more efficiently.
